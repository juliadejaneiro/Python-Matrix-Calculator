# Python Matrix Calculator
A simple matrix calculator to practice my Python and linear algebra skills.
This calculator performs basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication), although there are plans for additional functionalities.
The calculator assumes user input is correct; validation of user input is to be added.

## Operations
- Addition & subtraction (completed)
- Matrix multiplication (completed)
- Transpose (completed)
- Inverse (incomplete)
- Conjugate transpose (incomplete)
- Unitary/not unitary (incomplete)

## Dependencies
This project requires the NumPy library. Use `pip install numpy` (pip) or `conda install numpy` (Anaconda) command(s).
For more information, consult the official NumPy resource: [NumPy - Installing NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/).

## Functionality
Run the Python script matrix_calculator.py.
You will encounter a menu of available commands. Enter the desired command when prompted.

Specify the dimensions of the matrix using two int values with a space between.
Then, enter the appropriate number of entries with spaces between. The entries on each line represent a row in the matrix.
